The Flow -http://bit.ly/2jUz4Br

From Primary: 

Primary education is sketchy at best. Even the schools with computing content are not teaching computational thinking. 

Most of the best learners are the enthusiasts who enjoyed some aspect of their learning and then pushed themselves. 

Majority of Y7 pupils have the "tell me what to do" mindset and get upset/lost when asked to apply what they know into a solution. 

Progression of Content: 

Year 7:

Basic computer use

* Searching

* Google App Suite
